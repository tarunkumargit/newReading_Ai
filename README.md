### INTRODUCTION
Conversational Voice Controlled React News Application using Alan AI and News API . For the front-end part I used React and Material-ui while the data is comming from the news api. For the Voice command Alan AI is used and biggest advantage of using Alan Ai is that its so easy to implement. The main project feature is user can use Voice to navigate around the page to get latest news around the world and can even do basic conversation with Alen Ai.


Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` to start development server
